							<h3>How we started.</h3>
							<p> Mark's charity began with a simple yet profound desire: to make a positive impact in the lives of those facing hardship. Fueled by compassion and empathy, Mark took the first steps toward realizing this vision.
								Gathering a team of like-minded individuals, they worked tirelessly to establish an organization dedicated to providing support to the vulnerable in their community. Through their collective efforts, the charity took shape, offering assistance and hope to those in need.
								Driven by a commitment to create lasting change, Mark and his team advocated for systemic reforms while providing immediate relief to those affected by adversity. Their dedication attracted support from volunteers, donors, and partners, forming a strong community united in their mission.
								Today, Mark's charity stands as a beacon of compassion, touching the lives of many and inspiring others to join in the effort to build a brighter future for all.</p>

									<p>
										In the stillness of his kitchen, Mark faced a sudden crisis that would change his life. Struck by "massive heart attacks," he collapsed, but from that moment emerged a journey of resilience and hope.
										As the founder of a charity, Mark had dedicated himself to helping others. Now, he found himself on the receiving end of that kindness. Through the challenges of recovery, he was buoyed by the unwavering support of his community.
										Mark's journey is a testament to courage and community. From hospital walls to rehabilitation, he never wavered in his commitment to make a difference. Today, he stands as a beacon of hope, showing that with strength and support, we can overcome any obstacle.</p>
